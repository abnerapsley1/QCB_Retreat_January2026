## The Whole-Cell Model: A Unifying Framework for Quantitative Cell Biology ##
The purpose of this GitHub repository is to help researchers affiliated with the QCB know how to make meaningful contributions toward the generation of whole-cell models. As such, the majority of this repository details the various aspects of whole-cell modeling and how experimental, computational, and theoretical labs can contribute to each of these areas. First, the overall aims of whole-cell modeling are described. Next, each of the individual components of a whole-cell model are explored. Finally, each component of the whole-cell modeling process is broken up into subcomponents which can serve as areas of focus for individual labs or teams. It is assumed that readers of this repository already understand the importance of whole-cell modeling as this topic will not be explored here. Rather, this repository serves as a guide for researchers and professionals who desire to contribute to the creation of whole-cell models.
