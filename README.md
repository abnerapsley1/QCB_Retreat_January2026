## The Whole-Cell Model: A Unifying Framework for Quantitative Cell Biology ##
The purpose of this GitHub repository is to help researchers affiliated with the QCB know how to make meaningful contributions toward the generation of whole-cell models. As such, the majority of this repository details the various aspects of whole-cell modeling and how experimental, computational, and theoretical labs can contribute to each of these areas. First, the overall aims of whole-cell modeling are described as well as each of the individual components of a whole-cell model are explored. Next, each component of the whole-cell modeling process is broken up into subcomponents which can serve as areas of focus for individual labs or teams. It is assumed that readers of this repository already understand the importance of whole-cell modeling as this topic will not be explored here. Rather, this repository serves as a guide for researchers and professionals who desire to contribute to the creation of whole-cell models.

## Overall Aims of the Whole-Cell Model ##

The overall aim of a whole-cell model is to provide a comprehensive description of the cell state across a defined period of time (often the length of the cell cycle). The whole-cell model is comprised of a description of the cell state, its initial conditions, and the computational procedures that define how the cell state evolves over time. After being constructed, whole-cell models must be realized through the used of a combination of hardware, software, and computational pipelines. After whole-cell models have been realized and results have been generated, this data can be used to perform statistical analyses, answer biological questions, visualize output, and compare output with experimental results.
